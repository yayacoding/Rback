// Problem: RBAC Authentication and Authorization API
// Description:You are tasked with creating an API that implements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). The system will have various user roles (Admin, Manager, and User) with different access levels to specific resources.
// The API will contain the following features:
// Authentication: User must log in with credentials (username/password) to receive a JWT token.
// Authorization: Depending on the role (Admin, Manager, User), users will have access to different endpoints.
// Error Handling: Provide detailed error messages for unauthorized access, invalid inputs, and server errors.
// Requirements:
// User Roles and Permissions:
// Admin: Can access all endpoints.
// Manager: Can access only manager-related endpoints.
// User: Can access only basic endpoints.
// End Points:
// POST /login: User logs in with username and password to receive a JWT token.
// GET /admin-dashboard: Only accessible by Admins.
// GET /manager-dashboard: Accessible by Admins and Managers.
// GET /user-dashboard: Accessible by all authenticated users (Admin, Manager, User).
// Middlewares:
// Authentication Middleware: Verifies the JWT token in the request headers.
// Authorization Middleware: Verifies the user's role and ensures they have the right permissions to access specific routes.
// Error Handling:
// 401 Unauthorized: For invalid or expired tokens.
// 403 Forbidden: For users who donâ€™t have access to a resource based on their role.
// 404 Not Found: For endpoints that do not exist or are unavailable.
// 500 Internal Server Error: For unexpected server-side issues.
